# Minecat

Minecat is a Minecraft plugin used to connect with Discord!

This was my first full project with java, I loved and hated it but I learned a lot from this. Websockets, java, plugins, java 'compiling' and also how weirdly strictly OOP java is but thats cool.

## Build from source???

Now I don't have much of an idea how I set this up either however:

1. Install JDK or OpenJDK or whatever
2. Install maven
3. `mvn clean install`
4. Pray.

## GPL3???

Now the license was just an afterthought. This is an end product so its not like GPL's viral tendencies will affect anyone.

## Contributors

Me, just me and only me, I like it that way.

## Is that it

Yeah, no idea what I'm meant to put here
